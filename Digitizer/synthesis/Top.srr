 Note: 'No paths' indicates there are no paths in the design for that pair of clock edges.
       'Diff grp' indicates that paths exist but the starting clock and ending clock are in different clock groups.

=======================================================================================================================================
Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 3.103 is 1.233(39.7%) logic and 1.870(60.3%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

=======================================================================================================================================
Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 5.786 is 1.602(27.7%) logic and 4.183(72.3%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 1.271 is 0.097(7.6%) logic and 1.174(92.4%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

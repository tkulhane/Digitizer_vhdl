@W: BN114 :|Removing instance CP_fanout_cell_Data_Block_verilog_inst (in view: work.Data_Block_rtl_ilm(verilog)) because it does not drive other instances.
@W: MO160 :"c:\vhdl_temp\digitizer\digitizer_ver2\digitizer\component\work\coreuart_c0\coreuart_c0_0\rtl\vlog\core\tx_async.v":119:0:119:5|Register bit xmit_state[4] (in view view:work.COREUART_C0_COREUART_C0_0_Tx_async_0s_0s_0s_1s_2s_3s_4s_5s_6s_Top(verilog)) is always 0. To keep the instance, apply syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
